    <question1>
      <title>Description of implementation and tests</title>
      <q1a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a clear description of the approach
          used to achieve before-or-after atomicity?
        </text>
        <answer>NO</answer>
      </q1a>
      <q1b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on any aspects that you found unclear in the
          description of the approach to achieve before-or-after atomicity
        </text>
        <answer>When is a read lock and/or write lock taken. There is a great description of how the reentrant read write lock works, but not how is applied in the implementation. To improve this include if and when a lock is released in the case of an execption. </answer>
      </q1b>
      <q1c>
        <text>
          Does the code include implementations of Tests 1 and 2 of the
          assignment description as well as of at least another two test
          cases?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1c>
      <q1d-i>
        <text>
          Is it tested that the final state resulting from concurrent
          execution
          is correct in that it respects invariants designed in the test?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-i>
      <q1d-ii>
        <text>
          Is it tested that intermediate reads of the state during concurrent
          execution respect invariants designed in the test, so that it is
          arguable that these intermediate states could be found in an
          equivalent serial schedule?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q1d-ii>
      <q1e>
        <text>
          Provide comments on why you found that any portions of the test
          descriptions were unclear according to the criteria, and suggestions for
          improvement
        </text>
        <answer>There is no description of the test, when looking at the implementation we can verify that the criteria are met. </answer>
      </q1e>
    </question1>

    <question2>
      <title>Correctness argument for locking protocol</title>
      <q2a>
        <text>
          Is the variant of 2PL to which equivalence is being established in
          the correctness argument clearly identified (e.g., conservative, strict,
          conservative strict)?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2a>
      <q2b>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argumentation of why the steps in the locking
          protocol designed correspond to steps taken in the chosen variant
          of 2PL?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q2b>
      <q2c>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>NO</answer>
      </q2c>
      <q2d>
        <text>
          Is there an argument for the need to take into account predicate
          reads, with appropriate justification?
        </text>
        <answer>No argument is preduced, but predicate reads are a nonissue as it requires finer grained locking than implemented. </answer>
      </q2d>
    </question2>

    <question3>
      <title>Deadlocks</title>
      <q3a>
        <text>
          Does the solution contain a correct argument for why deadlocks can
          occur in the locking protocol or why deadlocks cannot occur?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q3a>
      <q3b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument provided with respect to
          deadlocks could be improved
        </text>
        <answer>The argument is well formed.</answer>
      </q3b>
    </question3>

    <question4>
      <title>Reflections on scalability</title>
      <q4a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument about the scalability limits of the
          concurrent implementation provided?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q4a>
      <q4b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the reflections on scalability could be
          improved
        </text>
        <answer>The argument could be more fully developed by discussing the challenges a table entry level locking scheme would face.</answer>
      </q4b>
    </question4>

    <question5>
      <title>Argumentation on decisions made for performance</title>
      <q5a>
        <text>
          Is there a sound argument in the solution about the trade-off between
          locking overhead and concurrency?
        </text>
        <answer>YES</answer>
      </q5a>
      <q5b>
        <text>
          Provide comments on how the argument about performance trade-offs in
          the locking protocol could be improved
        </text>
        <answer> The argument that the locking protocol is appropriate is solid under the assumption that bookstore serves private customers and not other bookstores. The archiecture also handles restocking the bookstores, for this purpose buying books would be more common than rating and getting details, in which case a finer granularity of write locks would be appropriate.</answer>
